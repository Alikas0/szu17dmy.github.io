## 端口
> [Port (computer networking)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_\(computer_networking\))
>
> The port numbers are divided into three ranges: the *well-known ports*, the *registered ports*, and the *dynamic* or *private ports*.

### 熟知端口
> The well-known ports (also known as system ports) are those from 0 through 1023. The requirements for new assignments in this range are stricter than for other registrations,[2] examples include:
  
+ 20: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Data Transfer
+ 21: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Command Control
+ 22: Secure Shell (SSH) Secure Login
+ 23: Telnet remote login service, unencrypted text messages
+ 25: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) E-mail routing
+ 53: Domain Name System (DNS) service
+ 80: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in the World Wide Web
+ 110: Post Office Protocol (POP3)
+ 119: Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
+ 123: Network Time Protocol (NTP)
+ 143: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Management of digital mail
+ 161: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
+ 194: Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
+ 443: HTTP Secure (HTTPS) HTTP over TLS/SSL

> The registered ports are those from 1024 through 49151. IANA maintains the official list of well-known and registered ranges.[3] The dynamic or private ports are those from 49152 through 65535. One common use for this range is for ephemeral ports.
